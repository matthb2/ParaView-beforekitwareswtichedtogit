// .NAME vtkTransmitPolyDataPiece - Return specified piece, including specified
// number of ghost levels.
// .DESCRIPTION
// This filter updates the appropriate piece by requesting the piece from 
// process 0.  Process 0 always updates all of the data.  It is important that 
// Execute get called on all processes, otherwise the filter will deadlock.
