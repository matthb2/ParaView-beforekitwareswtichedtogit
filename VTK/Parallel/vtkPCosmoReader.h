// .NAME vtkPCosmoReader - Read a binary cosmology data file
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPCosmoReader creates a vtkUnstructuredGrid from a binary cosmology file.
// The file contains fields for:
//     x_position, x_velocity (float)
//     y_position, y_velocity (float)
//     z-position, z_velocity (float)
//     mass (float)
//     identification tag (integer)
//
// If the file contains particle information x,y,z is the location of the
// particle in simulation space with a velocity vector and a mass which
// will be the same for all particles.
//
// If the file contains halo information x,y,z is the location of the
// particle which is the centroid of all particles in the halo and
// the mass is the collective mass of the halo.  In order to find the
// number of particles in a halo, take the mass of a single particle
// and divide it into the mass of a halo.
//
// The stride variable will read every nth particle into the unstructured
// grid to get a subsampling.  It has been noted that this is not the best
// thing to do for subsampling since particle points are generated in
// stripes.  A better thing to do would be to take a random sampling.
